CHEAT SHEETS AND OTHER INTERESTING DOCUMENTS
============================================

I recently figured that I spend way too much time on the net searching for the
same things over and over again. Blogs make good tools for noting down
information about big tasks, but usually it's the tiny odd-job that you are
looking to get done, or that one special or obscure command that you
_just can't remember_. I intend to note such things down in this repo.
