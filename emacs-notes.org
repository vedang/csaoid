** OP's Requirements:
Features I want (have no issue trying to add manually, but would like to see it there) -
+ Project Management
+ LSP with Linting
+ Popup/Toggle-based Terminals

** My Answer:
I'd be happy to explain /  work with you on these requirements. What you are looking for:
1. ~project.el~ : Understanding what a project is (actions like searching in projects, switching projects, opening files in projects etc). IF you mean the other project management (task management) then ~org-mode~ which is a beast of it's own. Both are built-ins.
2. ~eglot~ for LSP. Invoke with ~M-x eglot~ from inside whichever project.
3. I did not understand what this means.

A long time back, I wrote some documents that you might find useful:

1. What a Programming Editor should be able to do : a list of table-stakes operations, and key-bindings for my setup of Emacs: https://github.com/vedang/emacs-up/blob/master/docs/02_what_a_programming_editor_should_do.org
2. An Opinionated Emacs Tutorial: Getting started fast. : A presentation I used to give in my previous work-place for getting started with Emacs: https://github.com/vedang/emacs-up/blob/master/docs/01_opinionated_emacs_tutorial.org (This is more philosophy than quick-tips, but might be useful to you)

mapc is similar to mapcar, expect that it does not accumulate the results.
mapc should be used for side-effects, where we don't care about the
return value.

  Taken right from the Emacs Manual (I always seem to forget this).
  http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Regexp-Replace.html

  M-x replace-regexp <RET> c[ad]+r <RET> \&-safe <RET>
  replaces (for example) ‘cadr’ with ‘cadr-safe’ and ‘cddr’ with ‘cddr-safe’.

  M-x replace-regexp <RET> \(c[ad]+r\)-safe <RET> \1 <RET>
  ‘\d’ in newstring, where d is a digit, stands for whatever matched the dth
  parenthesized grouping in regexp.
  Note : The parens making groups need to be escaped.

This command is created by:
1. Run the command ~sudo apt build-dep emacs~ and copy all the packages it will install. (*Don't actually install the packages*)
2. Remove all the ImageMagick related libraries from this command, we have installed it from source.
3. Review the output of ~./configure~ command in Emacs. See if there are new options which are not covered by your distribution's old version of Emacs.

Note: if you are doing this for the first time, you need to run =./autogen.sh= as the first command. This command creates the ~configure~ script and various Makefiles, which we use in the next commands.

#+begin_src fish
  make distclean
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure --with-imagemagick --with-json --with-native-compilation --with-xft --with-xwidgets --with-pgtk --with-tree-sitter

  ./configure --without-toolkit-scroll-bars --with-x-toolkit=gtk3 --with-xpm=ifavailable --with-jpeg=ifavailable --with-gif=ifavailable --with-tiff=ifavailable --with-xml2 --with-rsvg --without-pop --with-png --with-mailutils --with-native-compilation --with-cairo --with-harfbuzz --with-tree-sitter --with-sqlite3
  # If everything works
  make bootstrap
  # If everything works
  make
  # Test the binary
  src/emacs -Q
  # Install the binary
  sudo make install
#+end_src

Notes:
1. There is no ~Makefile~ before you run ~autogen.sh~ for the first time.
2. You need to install ~libgccjit-<x>-dev~ where ~<x>~ is your gcc version. =gcc --version=. (for native compilation support)
3. You need to install ~libtree-sitter-dev~ (for tree-sitter support)

* Compiling and Running Emacs 29 on master branch (Mac)

I successfully compiled Emacs from source on the M1 Macbook Air right now (from https://github.com/jimeh/build-emacs-for-macos/). Noting down the steps in the hopes it will help others.

Initially, I had a linker failure ~ld: library not found for -lwebp~. I added the line ~brew 'webp'~ to the ~Brewfile~ to install this dependency. However, later I realized that the problem was because the correct ~LIBRARY_PATH~ was not being set. So I'm not sure if this change is needed.

The actual commands I executed were:
#+begin_src sh :eval no
  brew bundle
  export LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/homebrew/lib/
  export CPATH=$CPATH:/opt/homebrew/include/
  ./build-emacs-for-macos --git-sha c00ffe263d9ffeb4d2a5e13cc124c786152137db
#+end_src

Once compilation was successful, I extracted the ~.tbz~ file created under ~builds~ and signed it as explained in https://github.com/jimeh/build-emacs-for-macos/pull/65/files
#+begin_src sh :eval no
  codesign --force --deep -s - Emacs.app

Of course you know about this feature of dired-mode.

You can mark files in Dired-mode and pipe them into a program.

- M-x dired-do-shell-command-async - =&=
- Command: =wc-l= to run the command on each marked file, =wc -l *= to
  run the command on all the files in one go.

~sql-interactive-mode~ is excellent and my preferred way of interactive with a database that supports SQL.

To start a SQLi buffer + work against a database:

1. ~M-x sql-<name-of-db>~ (eg: ~sql-postgres~). If you have the ~.dir-locals.el~ file (see below), values will be auto filled in. This will start an interactive SQL buffer.
2. Open a .sql file to write SQL in.
3. In this file, ~M-x sql-set-product~, followed by ~M-x sql-set-sqli-buffer~.

To speed up connection to an SQL database, add the following to a ~.dir-locals.el~ file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ((sql-mode . ((sql-product . postgres)
                (sql-user . "pgw")

                (sql-port . 5432)
                (sql-server . "192.168.33.10")
                (sql-database . "pgw-main"))))

- As a one-time run, you can also execute the following code after  =M-x ielm=
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (native-compile-async "/home/<yourname>/.emacs.d" t)

  modification broke, which used =substitute-key-definition= and
  substituted a function which took optional arguments with another
  function which took 0 arguments. This seems to not work within
  native compilation.
