* Conditional Breakpoints
** Conditionals on strings
   (gdb) set $string_var = "StringToMatch"
   (gdb) cond 1 strcmp (string_variable_in_code, $string_var) == 0

* Inserting a breakpoint in code
  - Can be done using inline ASM code.
    asm volatile ("int3;");
  - These can't be disabled, so it's a good idea to keep them conditional. For eg:
    if (NULL == string) {
        /* I want to break here */
        asm volatile ("int3;");
    }
  - Example code : https://github.com/kmcallister/embedded-breakpoints
